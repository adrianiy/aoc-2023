# BOAT RACE

Your toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond.
For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button,
the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.

To see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of 
ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example,
if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).
